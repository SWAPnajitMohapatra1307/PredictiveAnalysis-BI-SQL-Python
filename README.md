# EV Sales Forecasting & Market Strategy Predictive Analysis for an Indian EV Company 

## üìù Project Summary & Business Impact

This project addresses the high-stakes challenge of strategic market expansion for an Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturer in the rapidly growing but highly fragmented Indian market. Faced with the risk of multi-million dollar capital misallocation, I moved beyond historical reporting to build a predictive analytics engine.

By cleansing a raw dataset of over **96,000 records** and training a tuned **RandomForest Regressor model**, I generated a granular **11-year sales forecast (2025-2035)**. This forecast serves as the foundation for a data-driven market entry and product strategy, translating complex data into actionable recommendations that directly impact ROI, production efficiency, and risk management.

The final deliverables include not just the predictive model but also a comprehensive **Business Report**,**Powerpoint Presentaion** and an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** designed for executive-level decision-making.

## üéØ The Business Problem: A High-Risk Expansion
An EV manufacturer is planning expansion in Indian Market but faces significant uncertainty. The market is a complex due to its diverse regional demands, consumer preferences, and seasonal trends. The core business challenge is to move beyond historical analysis and develop a **forward-looking, predictive strategy** to guide investment and operations.

This analysis was designed to answer four critical business questions:

1.  **Market Prioritization:** Which states offer the highest ROI(Return of Investment) for investment in dealerships and marketing?
2.  **Product Mix Optimization:** What vehicle types (e.g., 2W Personal, 3W Shared) will be most in-demand in key regions?
3.  **Risk Mitigation:** Which markets show the slowest adoption trends, indicating a need for a cautious investment strategy?
4.  **Operational Efficiency:** How can we leverage seasonal demand patterns to optimize supply chain and marketing campaigns?

An EV manufacturer needed to define its 5-10 year growth strategy. Investing without data-driven guidance could lead to:
* **Capital Burn:** Sinking millions into dealerships and marketing in low-growth states.
* **Inventory Misalignment:** Producing vehicles that don't match regional demand, leading to high holding costs and lost sales.
* **Inefficient GTM (Go-to-Market):** Launching marketing campaigns during off-peak seasons, resulting in a low ROI(Return of Investment).

My objective was to replace guesswork with a quantitative, predictive framework to guide every strategic decision.


## üí° Solution & Key Insights 

#### **1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (cleaning_data.ipynb)**

The initial dataset contained **96,895** records with **significant data quality issues**. A rigorous cleaning process was performed in Pandas to ensure the reliability of the analysis.

* **Handled Null & Duplicate Records:** Identified and removed a total of **1,942 records** that were **either null entries or duplicates**. This crucial step reduced the dataset to 94,953 high-quality records for modeling.

* **Corrected Data Types & Formats:** Rectified the data type of the Year column, converting it from float to integer (e.g., 2014.0 to 2014).


* **Standardized Categorical Data:** Cleaned and standardized** 5 key categorical columns (State, Month_Name, Vehicle_Class, etc.)** by **removing leading/trailing whitespaces** and **enforcing consistent capitalization.**

#### **2. Predictive Modeling & Forecasting(Predictive_data_analysis...ipynb)**

With a clean dataset of **94,953 records**, a predictive model was built to forecast future EV sales based on **6 key features (State, Vehicle_Class, Vehicle_Type, Month_Num, etc.).**

**Data Pre-processing with SQL:(Using SQLite library of python)** Initially loaded the data into a SQLite database, using 5 distinct SQL commands (CREATE TABLE, SELECT DISTINCT, UPDATE, etc.) to perform initial deduplication and aggregation.

**Feature Engineering:** Transformed **4 primary categorical features into a machine-readable numerical format** using Scikit-learn's LabelEncoder.

**Model Training & Tuning:** The dataset was split into an **80% training set (approx. 75,962 samples)** and a **20% testing set (approx. 18,991 samples)**.

**A RandomForestRegressor model was trained on 11 years of historical data (2014-2024).**

Model performance was optimized using **GridSearchCV** to systematically test **18 different hyperparameter combinations with 3-fold cross-validation**, identifying the optimal model configuration **(n_estimators: 200, min_samples_split: 2, max_depth: None)**.

**Forecasting:** The final, tuned model was used to generate a granular, **11-year sales forecast (from 2025 to 2035)**. The forecast predicts sales for each specific state, vehicle type, vehicle category, and month, creating millions of future data points for analysis.
#### **3. Insight Generation & Visualization**
The final phase focused on translating the raw forecast data into clear, actionable business intelligence.

Strategic Visualization: Developed **7 distinct strategic visualizations** using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide direct answers to the core business questions.


#### * 1st **Achievement: Identified Top 5 High-ROI States for Capital Allocation**

* **Methodology:** Aggregated total predicted sales for the 11-year forecast period across **28 states and union territories** to create a data-driven market prioritization matrix.
* **Factual Insight:** The analysis identified **Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Bihar** as the Top 5 states for future investment, which together are predicted to account for a significant majority of future sales.
* **Business Impact:** This provides a clear roadmap for where to concentrate capital expenditure on dealerships and marketing to achieve the highest possible return on investment.
